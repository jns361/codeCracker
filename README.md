# 🎮CodeCracker
A simple C# console game where you guess a secret 4-digit code with limited tries – inspired by Wordle.

# ❓How does it work
First you choose your difficulty. You can choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard. The different difficulties affect your total amount of guesses you have, nothing else.

After you're done with that, a random 4-digit code is generated. You have to guess this code in a certain amount of tries.
When entering a guess (with the numbers from 0-9), you instantly get feedback inspired by the famous game 'Wordle'.
You're told how many of the digits in your guess are already correct and which are in the code, but not on their correct position.
This feedback can look like this:

X digit/s are correct and on the right position!
X digit/s are correct but on the wrong position!

X represents the amount of digits that fit the sentence.

The game ends when you either guess the exact code or you have no guesses left.
You can always choose to play again in the end.

# 💡How I got the Idea
I just wanted to repeat most of the things I've learned until today and asked an AI to give me a small exercise. This small exercise was small in the beginning, but I ended up getting more ideas of what could possibly be added and tried it. This now is the first complete result that I'm comfortable showing publicly.

# 💭My thoughts on the project
I had a lot of fun coding this. I think regardless of its simplicity it's a fun little game that brings fun, and if it does that only a few minutes a week, that still makes me happy.

# 📝Learning progression
The project was nice for repeating all of the stuff I've learned until now. I got to practice everything in a fun way and it definetly also taught me something new! 
In my opinion, this is a solid base I can build on considering I started with C# just a bit more than a week ago.
